Git

1. Clone Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/octa-byte-ai.git
cd octa-byte-ai
2. Set Up Infrastructure
bash# Initialize Terraform backend
cd terraform
terraform init

# Plan infrastructure changes
terraform plan -var-file="environments/staging/terraform.tfvars"

# Deploy infrastructure
terraform apply -var-file="environments/staging/terraform.tfvars"
3. Deploy Application
bash# Build and push Docker image
./scripts/deploy.sh staging

# Check deployment status
./scripts/health-check.sh staging
4. Access Application
bash# Get load balancer URL
terraform output -raw alb_dns_name

# Test API endpoints
curl https://your-alb-url.amazonaws.com/health
curl https://your-alb-url.amazonaws.com/api/users
📊 Monitoring & Observability
Grafana Dashboards

Infrastructure Dashboard: CPU, Memory, Network metrics
Application Dashboard: Request latency, error rates, throughput

CloudWatch Alarms

High CPU utilization (>80%)
High memory usage (>85%)
Application error rate (>5%)
Database connection failures

Logging

Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
Centralized logs in CloudWatch
Log retention: 30 days (configurable)

🔐 Security Features
Infrastructure Security

VPC with private subnets for compute resources
Security groups with minimal required access
RDS in private subnet with encryption at rest
Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager

Application Security

Rate limiting middleware
Request/response logging
Health check endpoints
Graceful shutdown handling

CI/CD Security

Container image vulnerability scanning
Dependency vulnerability checks
Secret scanning in repository
Immutable infrastructure deployments

📈 Cost Optimization
Infrastructure Optimization

ECS Fargate: Pay-per-use computing
RDS: Right-sized instances with automated backups
ALB: Shared load balancer across environments
CloudWatch: Optimized log retention policies

Estimated Monthly Costs (staging)

ECS Fargate (2 tasks): ~$30
RDS db.t3.micro: ~$15
ALB: ~$25
CloudWatch: ~$5
Total: ~$75/month

🚨 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. Terraform State Lock
bash# Force unlock (use carefully)
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID
2. ECS Task Startup Failures
bash# Check ECS logs
aws logs tail /ecs/go-app --follow
3. Database Connection Issues
bash# Test database connectivity
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- nc -zv db-host 5432
Health Check Endpoints
bash# Application health
curl https://your-app.com/health

# Readiness check
curl https://your-app.com/ready

# Detailed metrics
curl https://your-app.com/metrics
📝 Deployment Guide
Staging Deployment
bash# 1. Deploy infrastructure
cd terraform
terraform apply -var-file="environments/staging/terraform.tfvars"

# 2. Deploy application
cd ../
./scripts/deploy.sh staging

# 3. Run smoke tests
./scripts/health-check.sh staging
Production Deployment
bash# 1. Create production branch
git checkout -b production
git push origin production

# 2. GitHub Actions will trigger deployment pipeline
# 3. Manual approval required for production deployment
# 4. Monitor deployment in Grafana dashboards
Rollback Process
bash# Quick rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback.sh production

# Or specify version
./scripts/rollback.sh production v1.2.3
